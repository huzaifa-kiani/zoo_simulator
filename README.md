Ticket Issuance: Issue tickets to visitors for specific habitats and view ticket details. Interactive User Interface: Users can select habitats and animals and view detailed information. How It Works The zoo contains predefined habitats (e.g., Aquatic, Terrestrial, Aviary). Each habitat has specific animals added to it. The user can: View available habitats. Select a habitat and see the animals within it. Select an animal to view its details. Issue a ticket for visiting the selected habitat. All issued tickets are stored and can be viewed. Classes Used Animal: Stores animal details such as name, species, age, diet, and feeding time. Includes a friend function to modify the animal's name. Habitat: Manages a list of animals, habitat ID, type, and ticket price. Ticket: Stores details of issued tickets, including ticket ID, visitor name, date, and price. ZooManager: Handles the entire zoo system, including habitats, tickets, and overall management. Prerequisites A C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to compile and run the code.
